# Internet-Technology

This repo consists of all reports to laboratories from subject Internet Techonologies and Standards. During those labs we analyse the behaviour of simulated networks,
set-up different protocols on said networks (like BGP or OSPF) and modify the networks creating VLAN's and AS's according to the requirements presented in the tasks.

I have performed all laboratories with the help of my group partner Kacper Zdyb.
